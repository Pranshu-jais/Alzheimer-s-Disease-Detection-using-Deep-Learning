# Alzheimerâ€™s Disease Detection using Deep Learning

## Project Overview

This project aims to detect Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from MRI images using **Deep Learning** techniques. Specifically, the system uses **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to classify MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's Disease:

- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Non-Demented
- Very Mild Demented

### Abstract

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to cognitive decline and dementia. Early detection is crucial for timely intervention. In this study, MRI scans are used to classify Alzheimer's Disease using a CNN model, achieving a training accuracy of **86.34%** and validation accuracy of **86.45%**.

## Existing System vs Proposed System

### Existing System
Existing methods for Alzheimer's detection rely on traditional machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA). These systems face issues such as:
- Small sample sizes
- Noisy data
- Unverified pathological data

### Proposed System
The proposed system uses **Deep Learning**, specifically CNNs, to automatically classify MRI scans. This approach is more robust and scalable, achieving higher accuracy in predicting Alzheimer's stages with the Kaggle dataset.

## Advantages of Proposed System

1. **Early Diagnosis**: Detects Alzheimer's Disease in its early stages, improving clinical outcomes.
2. **Accuracy**: CNNs are highly effective in pattern recognition tasks, ensuring reliable classification.
3. **Automated Process**: Reduces human error and provides an efficient, scalable solution for healthcare providers.
